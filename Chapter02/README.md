# 第2章特征理解 我的数据里有什么？
本章主要讲述以下内容
* 结构化数据与非结构化数据
* 定量数据与定性数据
* 数据的4个等级
* 探索性数据分析和数据可视化
* 描述性统计。
## 2.1数据结构的有和无
* 结构化数据，就是有组织的数据，可以分成观察值和特征值的数据一般以表格的形式组织，行是观察值，列是特征
* 非结构化数据 也就是无组织的数据，作为自由流动的实体，不遵循标准组织的结构（例如表格）的数据，通常非结构化数据，在我们看来是一团数据，或只有一列或特征。
## 2.2定量数据和定性数据
* 定量数据本质上是数值，应该是衡量某种东西的数量
* 定性数据本质上是类别，应该是描述某样东西的性质
